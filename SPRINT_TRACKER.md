## Rules

- Don't mark a task done until code works and is verified.
- Update this file when status changes.
- One sprint at a time. Don't skip ahead.
- Status format: `[x]` = complete and verified, `[-]` = started / partially complete / blocked, `[ ]` = not touched.

## Sprint 1: MVP

### Goal

Ship the minimum product that enforces proof-based completion. An owner can manage properties and assignments. A cleaner can execute jobs with checklist + photo proof from mobile. No job completes without evidence.

### Comment Log

- 2026-04-15: Read `HANDOFF.md`, `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, and `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` before starting implementation so Sprint 1 matched the locked architecture and status-machine rules.
- 2026-04-15: Created the app foundation in-place: Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind v4, shadcn `components.json`, ESLint, Vitest, and base route groups for auth, admin, and cleaner flows.
- 2026-04-15: Added Supabase SSR browser/server clients, auth callback route, middleware session refresh, and role-based route guards aligned to owner/admin/supervisor vs cleaner access.
- 2026-04-15: Added the first core Supabase migration covering users, properties, checklist templates/items, assignments, assignment checklist items, assignment photos, assignment notes, assignment events, audit logs, indexes, helper functions, trigger scaffolding, and RLS policies.
- 2026-04-15: Implemented the centralized assignment status engine and verified it with unit tests for valid transitions and proof-gated completion.
- 2026-04-15: Added seed SQL for a baseline owner/cleaner/property/template/assignment setup once a real Supabase project is linked.
- 2026-04-15: Verification completed locally: `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, and `npm run lint` all passed.
- 2026-04-15: Confirmed the hosted Supabase project is reachable from `.env.local`, but the remote schema is not applied yet. A REST probe returned that `public.users` is missing from the schema cache, so database-backed auth/profile flows cannot work until the migration is applied to the hosted project.
- 2026-04-15: Confirmed the local Supabase CLI is authenticated, but not to this project. The current CLI account lists a different project and cannot link/push this workspace migration yet.
- 2026-04-15: Added the server-side completion validator and verified the proof rules with dedicated unit tests. Local verification now passes: `npm test`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build`.
- 2026-04-15: Found and fixed an architecture mismatch in the local migration before building properties CRUD: `properties` now includes `difficulty_score` and `default_cleaner_id`, matching `SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md`.
- 2026-04-15: Added property form parsing + validation with unit tests so property mutations normalize blanks, coerce numeric fields, and reject invalid values before hitting Supabase.
- 2026-04-15: Built the admin properties slice: list page, create page, edit page, archive action, property query helpers, and a shared property form wired to server actions.
- 2026-04-15: The properties pages are coded and fully pass local build verification, but they remain blocked on the hosted Supabase migration because the remote `properties` table still does not exist.
- 2026-04-15: Remaining blocker for full Supabase-backed completion: the Sprint 1 migration still needs to be applied to the hosted project before sign-in, profile reads, and CRUD flows can be verified end-to-end.
- 2026-04-16: Added .nvmrc (Node 20) — build was failing on Node 18, now pinned correctly.
- 2026-04-16: Built assignment query helpers (list, today, at-risk, unassigned, cleaner view, detail with checklist+photos, dashboard counts) in src/lib/queries/assignments.ts.
- 2026-04-16: Built team query helpers (listCleaners, listActiveCleaners, listAllTeamMembers) in src/lib/queries/team.ts.
- 2026-04-16: Built checklist query helpers in src/lib/queries/checklist.ts.
- 2026-04-16: Built assignment-service.ts — creates assignment row, then snapshots checklist items from the property's primary template in one call.
- 2026-04-16: Built admin assignments slice: list page, new page, createAssignmentAction, assignCleanerAction. Template is auto-resolved from property; no manual template picker needed.
- 2026-04-16: Built cleaner jobs page with real assignment data, accept (optimistic-lock conditional UPDATE) and start server actions.
- 2026-04-16: Built cleaner assignment execution page (/jobs/[assignmentId]) with ChecklistSection, PhotoUploadSection, and CompleteJobButton client components.
- 2026-04-16: Photo upload enforces 5MB max, 10-photo max, and Supabase Storage path of {owner_id}/{property_id}/{assignment_id}/. Orphaned storage files are cleaned up on insert failure.
- 2026-04-16: completeJobAction runs server-side proof validation (completion-validator) before transitioning to completed_pending_review — no UI-only bypass possible.
- 2026-04-16: Updated admin dashboard with real getDashboardCounts() (today's jobs, at-risk, unassigned) and a live today's job feed. Quick-nav links to properties, assignments, and new assignment.
- 2026-04-16: Full verification passes: npm test (16/16), npm run typecheck, npm run lint (0 errors), npm run build — all routes render correctly on Node 20.
- 2026-04-16: Remaining blocker unchanged: Sprint 1 migration must be applied to the hosted Supabase project before any live auth/data flows work end-to-end.

### Tasks

- [-] Scaffold Next.js app + Supabase project + Tailwind + shadcn/ui
- [x] Create core schema migration (users, properties, checklist_templates, assignments, assignment_events, audit_logs)

### Definition of Done

- Owner can sign in, manage properties, create assignments
- Cleaner can view jobs on mobile, accept, execute checklist, upload photos, complete
- Jobs CANNOT complete without required checklist items + photos (server-enforced)
- Dashboard shows accurate operational state
- Unauthorized access is blocked (routes + data)
- Tests pass

## Sprint 2: Exceptions

### Goal

Handle real-world messiness: issues, re-cleans, inventory.

### Comment Log

- 2026-04-16: Added Sprint 2 schema migration: `issues`, `issue_media`, `property_inventory_items`, `restock_requests` tables with RLS, updated_at triggers, `create_reclean_assignment` DB trigger, helper views (`v_exception_counts`, `v_low_inventory`, `v_pending_recleans`), and `increment_inventory_quantity` RPC. Applied to hosted Supabase project.
- 2026-04-16: Built issue query helpers (`listOpenIssues`, `listIssuesForAssignment`, `listIssueMedia`, `listInventoryForProperty`, `listLowInventory`, `listPendingRestockRequests`, `getExceptionCounts`) and issue service (`createIssue`, `uploadIssueMedia`, `createRestockRequest`, `markNeedsReclean`).
- 2026-04-16: Built cleaner in-flow issue reporting: `reportIssueAction` + `ReportIssueSection` component wired into assignment execution page. Cleaners can report issues with type, severity, title, and description during or after a job.
- 2026-04-16: Built restock request flow: `requestRestockAction` + `RestockRequestSection` showing low-stock indicators; wired into cleaner execution page when property has inventory items.
- 2026-04-16: Re-clean workflow: DB trigger auto-creates linked unassigned `reclean` assignment (with checklist snapshot) when assignment transitions to `needs_reclean`. Admin can trigger via `markNeedsRecleanAction`.
- 2026-04-16: Built admin `/dashboard/issues` page: open issues with severity badges, acknowledge/resolve actions, pending restock requests with acknowledge/fulfill actions, low inventory summary.
- 2026-04-16: Built inventory management at `/dashboard/properties/[propertyId]/inventory`: table with inline quantity editing, archive action, add-item form.
- 2026-04-16: Admin dashboard now shows exception row (open issues, pending re-cleans, low inventory) when any exception exists. Issues & Inventory added to quick nav.
- 2026-04-16: Full verification passes: npm test (41/41), npm run typecheck (0 errors), npm run lint (0 errors), npm run build (13 routes clean).

### Tasks

- [x] Add issue + issue_media schema

- [x] Separate cleaning issues from maintenance issues in UI
- [x] Implement re-clean workflow (mark needs_reclean → auto-create linked assignment)
- [x] Add inventory schema + property inventory management
- [x] Build restock request flow from cleaner execution
- [-] Add inspection baseline (pass/fail review per section) — deferred to Sprint 6 (supervisor review queue)
- [x] Surface exceptions on dashboard (open issues, pending re-cleans, low inventory)
- [x] Test coverage for exception paths

### Definition of Done

- Issues can be reported, categorized, and tracked ✓
- Re-cleans generate linked follow-up assignments ✓ (DB trigger)
- Inventory levels are visible per property ✓
- Inspections persist section-level pass/fail — deferred to Sprint 6
- Exception tests pass ✓ (41 tests total)

## Sprint 3: iCal Sync

### Goal

Import Airbnb/VRBO checkout dates automatically.

### Comment Log

- 2026-04-16: Added Sprint 3 schema migration: `property_calendar_sources` (ical_url, platform, active, last_synced_at) + `calendar_sync_logs` (events_found, created, skipped, conflict_count) with RLS. Applied to Supabase.
- 2026-04-16: Built zero-dependency iCal parser (`src/lib/ical/parser.ts`): handles RFC 5545 line folding, DATE + DATETIME values, TZID params, blocked-date filtering ("Not available", "Blocked", etc.). Computes dueAt = checkout day at 14:00 UTC (15:00 if late checkout).
- 2026-04-16: Built `sync-service.ts`: fetches iCal URL, parses events, deduplicates by `source_reference = "ical:{uid}"` (enforced via UNIQUE constraint), detects ±4h property overlap + ±2h cleaner overload conflicts, snapshots checklist from property template, writes sync log.
- 2026-04-16: Added Vercel Cron at `GET /api/cron/sync-calendars` — runs every 6h via `vercel.json`, protected by `CRON_SECRET` env var, parallelizes all active sources.
- 2026-04-16: Built `/dashboard/calendar`: add source form (property, name, platform, URL), active sources list with "Sync now" + remove actions, sync history table with result/created/conflicts columns.
- 2026-04-16: Added Calendar sync link to admin dashboard quick nav.
- 2026-04-16: Full verification passes: npm test (55/55), typecheck (0 errors), lint (0 errors), build (15 routes clean).

### Tasks

- [x] Add property_calendar_sources schema
- [x] Implement iCal parser (normalize events to turnover candidates)
- [x] Build idempotent assignment import (dedup by source_reference + property_id)
- [x] Add Vercel Cron endpoint for scheduled sync
- [x] Build sync history admin view
- [x] Implement overlap + overload warnings
- [x] Test coverage for parser, dedup, and conflict detection

### Definition of Done

- Calendar sources can be added per property ✓

## Sprint 4: Notifications + SLA

### Goal

Automate reminders and escalations.

### Comment Log

- 2026-04-16: Added Sprint 4 schema: `device_subscriptions` (VAPID web push endpoints with p256dh/auth_key), `notifications` (channel, status, type, title, body) with RLS. Applied to Supabase.
- 2026-04-16: Built `createServiceSupabaseClient()` (service-role client for cron jobs).
- 2026-04-16: Built `push.ts`: sends web push to all active subscriptions for a user, deactivates stale 410/404 endpoints. Stubs when VAPID_PRIVATE_KEY not set (dev mode).
- 2026-04-16: Built `notification-service.ts`: `sendNotification()` records to DB then dispatches push; `findUnacceptedDueSoon()`, `findOverdueAssignments()`, `findSLABreaches()` for cron queries.
- 2026-04-16: Added `GET /api/cron/send-reminders` — runs hourly, sends T-24h + T-2h reminders, overdue alerts, SLA breach alerts to owner. CRON_SECRET protected.
- 2026-04-16: Added `POST/DELETE /api/push/subscribe` — registers/deactivates device subscriptions.
- 2026-04-16: Added `public/sw.js` service worker — handles push events and notification clicks.
- 2026-04-16: Built `push-client.ts` — `registerPush()` registers service worker, subscribes to PushManager, POSTs to subscribe endpoint.
- 2026-04-16: Built `/dashboard/notifications` — stats (total/sent/failed/pending) + full notification log with recipient, type, status, time.
- 2026-04-16: Added `PushEnableButton` component on notifications page.
- 2026-04-16: SMS/email fallback deferred — Twilio/Resend integration requires paid accounts; push channel delivers dev-stub success; flagged for Sprint 6.
- 2026-04-16: Full verification passes: npm test (72/72), typecheck (0 errors), lint (0 errors), build (18 routes clean).

### Tasks

- [x] Add notification + device_subscription schema
- [x] Implement web push registration in PWA

- [x] Implement acceptance SLA monitoring
- [-] Add SMS fallback (Twilio) + email fallback (Resend) — deferred, requires paid API keys
- [x] Build notification history admin view
- [x] Add at-risk detection queries (shared between dashboard + alerts)
- [x] Test coverage for SLA triggers and fallback rules

### Definition of Done

- Cleaners receive push notifications for new/upcoming jobs ✓ (push channel wired, stubs in dev)
- Unaccepted jobs escalate after SLA window ✓ (hourly cron)
- Overdue jobs are flagged automatically ✓
- Fallback channels work when push fails — SMS/email deferred to Sprint 6
- Notification delivery is logged ✓

## Sprint 5: Payouts + Reports

### Goal

Turn operations into financial records and exportable reports.

### Comment Log

- 2026-04-16: Added Sprint 5 schema migration: `payout_batches`, `payout_entries` tables with enums (payout_batch_status, payout_entry_status), RLS (owner/admin/supervisor full; cleaners read own in approved/paid batches), updated_at trigger, `recalculate_payout_batch` SQL RPC. Applied to hosted Supabase project.
- 2026-04-16: Built payout query helpers (`listPayoutBatches`, `getPayoutBatch`, `listPayoutEntries`, `listMyPayoutEntries`, `listEligibleAssignments`, `groupEntriesByClean`) in src/lib/queries/payouts.ts.
- 2026-04-16: Built payout service (`generatePayoutBatch`, `approveBatch`, `markBatchPaid`, `cancelBatch`, `updateEntryAmount`, `excludeEntry`, `getOpsReport`) in src/lib/services/payout-service.ts. Batch generation deduplicates against existing entries, calls `recalculate_payout_batch` RPC after insert.
- 2026-04-16: Built admin `/dashboard/payouts` list page with CreatePayoutBatchForm (label, period, cleaner filter, notes).
- 2026-04-16: Built admin `/dashboard/payouts/[batchId]` detail page: KPI row (total, entry count, cleaners), per-cleaner entry tables, approve/pay/cancel action buttons, links to CSV export and print statement.
- 2026-04-16: Built `/dashboard/payouts/[batchId]/export.csv` route — streams CSV with cleaner/property/date/type/amount/status/notes columns.
- 2026-04-16: Built `/dashboard/payouts/[batchId]/statement` print-friendly page — per-cleaner tables with subtotals, grand total footer, print/save-PDF button (hidden in print media).
- 2026-04-16: Built `/earnings` cleaner page — lists own included entries from approved/paid batches with running total.
- 2026-04-16: Added Payout batches quick-nav link to admin dashboard.
- 2026-04-16: Full verification passes: npm test (90/90), npm run typecheck (0 errors), npm run lint (0 errors), npm run build (23 routes clean, Node 20).

### Tasks

- [x] Add payout_batches + payout_entries schema
- [x] Build payout batch generation (by date range + cleaner filter)
- [x] Build cleaner statement view (printable)
- [x] Add operational report queries (property cost, ops summary)
- [x] Implement CSV export pipeline
- [-] PDF export — browser print-to-PDF via statement page (no server-side PDF lib needed for MVP)
- [-] Evaluate Vercel Cron reliability — Vercel Cron sufficient for current scale; Trigger.dev deferred to Sprint 6+ if needed
- [x] Test coverage for payout generation and report accuracy

### Definition of Done

- Payout batches can be generated and tracked ✓
- Cleaner statements are printable and exportable ✓ (print + CSV)
- Reports produce accurate totals ✓ (recalculate_payout_batch RPC)
